The escalating violence in the Boko haram-controlled regions of northeastern Nigeria has caused severe unstable access to food and the undermining of livelihood in the presence of the suppression. People have become displaced in an attempt to look for food that disrupted business, farming, and access to basic service. The mass of the displaced is unwilling to return to their homes thereby putting more strain on the economy. The Nigerian government and military have made an effort to retake areas controlled by Boko Haram. However, military strategies such as screening tests and communication limitations also posed problems to livelihood. There is also a wide gap of time between the start of mass-scale displacement and international organization interventions creating a game of catch-up with the delivery of foreign aids.

For the research proposal firstly, international organizations should continue to put pressure on the Nigerian government to further infiltrate the remote regions. Further funds should be put into the world food program, the UN air services, and improvements to telecommunications, storage enlargement in areas of severe needs. The use of Space-time permutation scan statistics could provide early detections of food shortages and allow for rapid responses. In this sense, Short term aid can provide the cushion and time that the country needs to strategize and create an agricultural sector that could provide self-sufficiency. Secondly, improvement to the agricultural sector. For example, the  'bush fallow rotation' is the current cropping strategy where land is cultivated for two to four years and left unused for upwards of 8 years for restoring soil fertility. This traditional practice can not keep up with the demand of the population. So mix cropping could be beneficial. Where multiple plants grow in the same field. To account for the various climates in the country as well as the relatively small-scale farms. The successful implementation of the plan could guide Nigeria to self-sufficiency and maintain a steady growth rate like its Asian counterparts. However, this proposal is no simple feat as the containment and elimination of Boko Haram will take immense force, time, and funding, but the premise is that the Nigerian military should be at the forefront of this effort with the backing of international organizations.

The central research question explores the relationship between food security and humanitarian crisis at the local level, and further in the prediction of severe hunger areas. The crisis faced in the Borno States is the result of various factors with multiple dimensions to the problem. The high levels of poverty and low education provide the perfect place for the radical Islamic group of Boko Haram to operate, where they control most of the Borno States with armed extreme violence. In connection to the rise of the acute food insecurity crisis, it is unsurprising that it exists in these areas with limited outside access and a high rate of displacement because of the constant violence. The complexity of the humanitarian crisis has no simple step-by-step solution and much information is censored or limited, so here only public surface-level information will be considered in the approach. 

Before the introduction of the research approach, it is important to highlight the effort already in place in combating the Boko Haram insurgency. Firstly, a joint task force composed of Nigeria’s military, police force, and state security services are created to provide coordinated military interventions, while in an attempt to establish diplomatic relations with Boko Haram. After the incident of the kidnapping of 274 school girls, neighboring countries of Benin, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon joined Nigeria as a part of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. The task force has successfully retaken various parts previously under Boko Haram control. However, no external forces have been deployed such as the UN peacekeeping force.

For the research approach firstly, the efforts made by the joint task force should be continuously pressured to attempt to regain control of more areas. Secondly, humanitarian efforts should focus on the allocation of displaced people and attempts to establish basic services for self-sustainment. With the priorities as food insecurity, malnutrition, conflict, epidemics, and natural disasters with the importance in that order. STPSS could also provide an early warning system for identifying places of high food insecurity risks. Factors such as seasonal information(time), unclear population distribution could all be remedied by the use of STPSS over a traditional field survey. One hypothesis could be that the constant fighting and bombing of essential locations such as airports from Boko haram have caused the displacement of hundred-thousands of people, limited access to the military, and humanitarian organizations that lead to lack of access to food and famine of the people. 

The overarching objective of the inquiry is to progressively unite the country of Nigeria under one rule. However, the first step and most important step resides in the strategies and foundation of the operation. For example, if an over-aggressive strategy is implemented it could lead to a full pledge war with Boko Haram, vice versa. If a slow process is adopted the effectiveness might be challenged. Therefore, the balance and method are crucial in the approach in Boko Haram eradication as well as subsequent humanitarian efforts for the people. Currently, there are an estimated 12,536 people at risk of famine in Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa states. This number should see a significant improvement with the backing of humanitarian help. Furthermore, displaced individuals could return to their homes and homesteads and rebuild a sustainable lifestyle. 

However, for everything to be safe sailing. It’s not without obstacles. The aggression of Boko Haram is often unpredictable and ruthless. For example the bombing of the Maiduguri International Airport in 2013 limited military and humanitarian access to unsafe road travel that greatly limited the delivery of essential resources. Although the airport reopened in 2015 it is no guarantee that it would not happen again. The lack of data is also an obstacle in the way of assessment and resource distribution for food insecurity. The availability of data is challenged due to the unsafe environment. The data challenge is most prevalent in two categories of malnutrition and mortality. The current systems can not predict hotspots of food insecurity. It also does not take into account seasonal information or other contributing factors of food insecurity, which could be remedied by some form of spatial scan statistic. Furthermore, population data is greatly out of sync with millions displaced or constantly moving, so any attempt to collect population data is often obsolete as the rate of change is too great. 
  
	From current data, it is known that areas of the Borno states face extreme conditions and famine. However, when considering the issue from another perspective famine is usually considered to be the worst outcome for a population usually occurring after a series of failures. It could also be used for tactical gains against Boko Haram. The current strategy used by the Nigerian military is to surround the areas of Borno state and essentially cut off all communication, trade, and movement of people in and out of the remote region. Humanitarian access to these remote areas is solely dependent on the Nigerian military for safety and travel. So the delivery of assistance is biased towards the will of the military. This completely derails the objective of the humanitarian efforts and the effectiveness of the aid distribution may be compromised. 
  
All current methods have been focused on the containment of Boko Haram and subsequent aid. It is a slow and taxing process. With no support from reliable data that the humanitarian efforts are actually reaching places of need or the right places for that matter.  Data from the UNOCHA Financial Tracking Service and the Central Emergency Response Fund suggests that Humanitarian funding for Nigeria was almost none existent in 2014. It was not until the declaration of a state of emergency that funding started to flow into the country. However, the ample amount of money and the scaled-up humanitarian efforts only met roughly one-third to half the goals it was set out to do. In a sense excess funding, are been spent on futile things. The proposal here is to take a step back and rely on big data and funds to develop a comprehensive array of early detecting systems first and foremost. The identification of hotspots and prediction of movement is the most crucial component in ensuring the right distribution of aids. Therefore, reports such as the Cadre Harmonisé that are Data Challenged, coordinatively challenged, access constrained could all be resolved. 
  
There are going to be objections with every plan. The main factors to consider are the safety of the actors involved, funding for the operation, and effectiveness of the proposed strategy. For each factor, an example will be used to justify and defend the argument. Firstly, the safety of humanitarian aid could be reminded by the method of delivery of the resources, physical on-ground protection of outside personnel, and fast rotations of workers. The workers should work closely in the local context and culture, which allows for better security measures. Humanitians workers should be well informed regarding the risks of their assignment as well as any changes to the risk level before every mission. Air transport of resources provided by the World Food Programme in a helicopter and other air crafts could also help majorly in improved safety measures. 

When talking about funding for Nigeria, data present the fact that funding has been multiplying with each consecutive year since 2014. However, one reason that could play a role in the cut of fundings could be the strained relationship between international humanitarian actors and the Nigerian government on their role in responding to the crisis, and the responsibility for the humanitarian emergencies that follow. In both, the strategies of the Nigerian military and Boko haram both have instances of human rights violations that cross paths with the premiss of humanitarian intervention. For example, guerilla tacks of Boko Haram severely limit livelihood causing mass displacement of people. If considering the crisis from the standpoint of individual freedom the Nigerian military has very similar practices with the barrack of Borno State. This could be resolved by continuing to pressure the Nigerian military and put sanctions in place for improved strategies. If severe violations are observed humanitarian aids could have the power to withdraw support. 

The budget will be very different from what it will be expected to be spent on. Money allocated towards resources, aid, and transportation in Nigeria totaled upwards of thousands of millions of dollars, in 2017 alone the amount of funding required was a whopping 1054 million dollars. Therefore, it would not be logical to devote the money to acquiring material or military efforts. Instead, the budget of 100,000 dollars will primarily focus on the development of the early detecting system. An estimated 90% of the money will be allocated for data collection because it is crucial to establish the foundation for the data-intensive statistical test. 10% of the money will be used for the actual cost of the spital test itself whether if it’s using preexisting models such as the space-time permutation scan statistic or other better suitable methods.
