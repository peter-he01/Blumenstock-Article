###Question 1: What is development

Amartya Sen approaches development with freedom as the main pillar that supports all other factors. These factors that contributes to development includes the types of freedoms such as economic, polictical, and personal to the unfreedoms that needs to be removed such as poverty, lack of econmic oppoutunities, and dictatorship.

###Question 2: Is this an expansive or narrower view of development?

The view that development is closely tied to freedom is a very broad view of what is development. Before reading the chapter, my idea of development was only limited to something along the lines of technological developments and modernerlization as the gauge or measurement of determining how developed a country or place was. However, Amartya Sen expanded on these two points by highlighting that technological advancements, growth of GNP, etc are only the result of different types of freedoms, but not the method to increase development.

###Question 5: What does Amartya Sen say about being generically against markets?

Like I stated in question 4, econmic freedom could be closely related economic effiency. However, the opposite side of this is that free economy increase the distribution of wealth, and
