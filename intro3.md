In an FAO conference, Sen addressed that Africa did not have a steady increase in food availability per capita compared to Asia. This has led to Nigeria as the focus country as a relevant reference point in explaining and investigating the reason for food insecurity. The latest Cadre Harmonis√© analysis indicated that a stunning 2.6 million people still face severe food insecurity mainly in the Northeastern regions of Nigeria. The transition from food self-sufficiency to food import dependence, due to the lack of funding for the agricultural sector has had a detrimental effect on the fragmented small-scale farms in Nigeria. Specifically in the areas of Borno State have created a complex system of humanitarian crisis. Armed insurgent groups, disruption of basic services, and poor education of health are all obstacles in providing uninterrupted access and even distribution of food. Moreover, the high levels of unstable food access and the subsequent coping strategies pose further unsustainable issues, which ultimately lead to chronic malnutrition in people and high mortality rates in children. 

The paper will attempt to explore what is the relationship between food security and humanitarian crisis at the local level, and further indications in the role of corruption at a local level. Spatial scanning statistics is a geospatial data technique that identifies Spatial clusters of food insecurity using a space-time permutation model. The identification of geographical clusters of food insecurity could have implications for better aid distribution for the right individuals.
