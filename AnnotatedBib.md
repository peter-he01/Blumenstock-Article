# Food Security 

## What is food security 

“Availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices”  The World Economic Summit (1974) 

Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO, 1984), defined food security as all individuals having access to sufficient and nutritious food to meet their needs and preferences for an active and healthy life. 

## Four dimensions of food security (FAO, 2018)

Food availability 

Food access

Food utilisation

Food stability

 Summary

The research brief from Stanford University focused on the integration of data science in the form of satellite imaging, and prediction models to supplement the flaws of traditional field methods of collecting and organizing data. These methods were used to investigate economic and agricultural characteristics in various African nations that remain at the forefront of poverty and starvation issues. In these countries, traditional ground surveys were costly and inconclusive. Therefore, by incorporating data science methods the researchers could gather Long-term measurement of yield gaps, Development of financial tools for farmers, Better targeting agricultural interventions, and Better evaluation of intervention impact.

Assessment 

In 2015, the United Nations identified 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with poverty and the elimination of hunger at the top of the priority list. Amartya Sen distinguished these issues as major sources of unfreedoms. “The world has unprecedented opulence and yet denies freedoms to vast numbers of people.” (Sen) If the basic need for living and survival were limited, then development is restricted as well. The research in this study focused on the enhancement of human abilities. Specifically, the examination of crop yield and agricultural interventions was carried out in an attempt the improve the health and living of the individuals. 

In Kenya, small farmed are owned by individuals, and self-reports were used to collect yield data, which lacked both quality and quantity. Because of this, the data was often inaccurate and contains a large error margin. To remedy this, inexpensive satellite imagery was used to estimate crop yield. This provided significant advantages to the accuracy of the data in combination with ground severy that was much more expensive. Satellite imagery presented many benefits as well that were stated in the summary. Satellite imagery was also used to determine the economic status of different countries. Using Hi-def images roads, urban, and farmlands were marked by machine learning, which suggested the economic well-being of an area. From these data, it was able to predict the average household consumption and calculate wealth in the area. 

The study aimed to decrease the large data gap that exists during economic development. The use of data science improves this by creating models that could potentially project/predict the future based on current data. To allocate aid and relief to the right place, to improve the livelihood of individuals are the two fundamental goals in the process of eliminating poverty. However, aid and support are only half of the equation. To escape poverty is only the first step in the human development track because what follows is the chance to be educated and improve the surrounding society. This way the country as a whole is on the path to obtaining true freedom.

Summary

The study focused on the application of data mining and machine learning algorithms on agricultural, climatic, and enviornmental datasets to further and  deepen the understanding on how food security is affected by government policies, pollution, and human conflicts in nigeria between 2011-2020. The researcher aimed to adress the following three questions. First, “How does climate change, environmental degradation, pollution and unresolved conflicts affect farming communities with implications for food security in Nigeria? Second, What are the empirical relationships between agricultural outputs, climate change, environmental degradation, pollution and unresolved conflicts in farming communities in Nigeria? Third, What are the determinants and predictors for a sustainable food security measure in Nigeria?
 
Using different analytical data processes, the study concluded that environmental degredations had significant impact on the reduction of yields, depletion of farmlands, increased irriagation, and more pests. Therefore, greatly increase food insecurity. Furthermore, high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition can have consequences on the economy. In Nigeria, the economy is heavily relied on the oil and gas sector, but before the discovery of oil agricultural had been the main sector. In recent years, there’s a gradual decline in funding for the agricultural sector, consequently greatly decreasing the food production. Moreover, petroleum exploration and production had greatly increased pollution of the enviornment. In the Nigeria’s Niger Delta region the soils and sediments, water, ecosystems had been hugely affected by the hydrocarbon waste streams, consequently it also impacted human health, degradation of communities and socio-economic problems in the area. Some determinants the researcher identified were policy ineffectiveness, high cost of production, high exchange rate, and increase in population. Civil unrest and the Boko haram insurgent had also played a factor in food insecurity. 

Assessment

One the surface, food insecurity in nigeria seems to be the results of the lack of funding and attention to the agriculture sector. That is ture to an extent, but the underline problems resides in the governing systems. Nigeria has an abundant number of of fertile agricultural land and ideal climates in combination with a plentiful human resources. However, the government is riddled with pervasive corruption and poor policy implementations. These issues are deepened by the constant civil unrests across the country. It is interesting when viewing food insecurity issues in Nigeria from the lens of Amartya Sen. Nigeria has a federal governing system, which in sen’s definitions are much less likely to to fall victim to huger/famine. Therefore, what could be inferred is that only a fair democratic system without corruption has the potential of exerting protective power. Food insecurity has also brought economic unfreedoms, and decrease in economic opportunities, specifically the shrinking agricultural sector had also increased unemployment.
