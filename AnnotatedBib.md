 Summary

The research brief from Stanford University focused on the integration of data science in the form of satellite imaging, and prediction models to supplement the flaws of traditional field methods of collecting and organizing data. These methods were used to investigate economic and agricultural characteristics in various African nations that remain at the forefront of poverty and starvation issues. In these countries, traditional ground surveys were costly and inconclusive. Therefore, by incorporating data science methods the researchers could gather Long-term measurement of yield gaps, Development of financial tools for farmers, Better targeting agricultural interventions, and Better evaluation of intervention impact.

 Assessment 

In 2015, the United Nations identified 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with poverty and the elimination of hunger at the top of the priority list. Amartya Sen distinguished these issues as major sources of unfreedoms. “The world has unprecedented opulence and yet denies freedoms to vast numbers of people.” (Sen) If the basic need for living and survival were limited, then development is restricted as well. The research in this study focused on the enhancement of human abilities. Specifically, the examination of crop yield and agricultural interventions was carried out in an attempt the improve the health and living of the individuals. 

In Kenya, small farmed are owned by individuals and self reports was used to collect yield data, which lacked in both quality and quantity. Because of this, the data was often inaccurate and contains a large error margin. To remedy this, inexpensive satellite imagery was used to estimate crop yield. This provided significant advantages to the accuracy of the data in combination with ground severy that was much more expensive. Satellite imagery presented many benefits as well that were stated in the summary. Satellite imagery was also used to determine the economic status of different countries. Using Hi-def images roads, urban, and farmlands were marked by machine learning, that suggested the economic well being of an area. From these data it was able to predict the average household consumption and calculate wealth in the area. 

Reflection 

The study aimed to decrease the large data gap that exist during economic development. The use of data science improves this by creating models that could potentially project/predict the future based on current data. To allocate aid and relief to the right place, to improve the livelihood of individual are the two fundamental goals in the process of eliminating poverty. However, aid and support are only half of the equation. To escape poverty is only the first step in the human development track, because what follows are the chance to be educated and improve the surrounding society. This way the country as a whole is on the path to obtain true freedom.
