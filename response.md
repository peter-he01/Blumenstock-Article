### Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.

The age of big data has transformed the approach to many issues around the globe. As Blumenstock memtioned, big data has helped aid organizations to identify people of need and target specific groups of people for financial packages.

#### “Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results. Nira Nair

#### “In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult.” Kayla Seggelke

### How do you response to these ideas regarding “good intent”, “transparency” and the difficult “balancing act” when consdiering the intersection of human development with data science?

The cumulating of big data are used tot develop many algorithms that control many hidden aspects of daily life. However, just like the checks and balances of the government systems, who checks these auto generated number of data that could potentrailly decide the fate of one's life. 

Here are three approaches
1. enforce the rule that any data used are solely for the benefit of improving individual lives and the welfare of society.
