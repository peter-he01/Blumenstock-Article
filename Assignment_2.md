### Draft title

How Technology and Investment in Agriculture could Improve Spatial Clusters of Food Insecurity in nigeria

### Reference to Sen and background/target country(Intro)

Nigeria will be the focus for the investigation. The existance of a “food security paradox” where locations with ideal agricultural conditions experience inadequacy in food is entruging. This is due to one,gradual decline in funding for the agricultural sector. two, increased the pollution due to oil export. Three, pervasive corruption and poor policy implementations. The two SDGs focuses are poverty and elimination of hunger.

Reference to Sen in that, Nigeria has a federal governing system, which in sen’s definitions are much less likely to fall victim to hunger/famine. Therefore, what could be inferred is that only a fair democratic system without corruption has the potential of exerting protective power. furthermore, it brought economic unfreedoms in the form of unemployment, which has led many families further into poverty and becoming reliant on international aids.

### Dimensions

The direct enhancement of human abilities, specifically improvement to the standards of living and cosequently leading to a long and healthy life. People of Nigeria faces many challenges that hider a healthly living. This is detrimental because if the basic need for living and survival were limited, then development is restricted as well. As stated by Sen “The world has unprecedented opulence and yet denies freedoms to vast numbers of people.” 

### Data science methods

First, data science method is Autoregressive Distribution Lag framework (econometric technique). The findings revealed that oil exports greatly negatively contributed to the low funding and care to agriculture that resulted in a high level of food insecurity. Because of this Folow’s technological change growth model  was used as a framework for analyzing the need for technology in agricultural production, processing, and storage. Factors such as savings, innovation systems, social protection played a role in upward shift in food production in the model. 

Secondly to identify food insecruity clusters, data were extracted from the nationally-representative panel data from the South African National Income Dynamics Study and the food insecurity geographical cluster was mapped out using Kulloff spatial scan statistic in SaTScan. 

### sub-theme

Social conditions such as policy ineffectiveness, high cost of production, high exchange rate, increase in population, and Civil unrest of the Boko haram insurgent all play a significant role in food accessability. The democratic processes of communication between the people and the government are clearly flawed in Nigeria. This socio-economic feature serves as the main reason behind people’s entitlement to food rather than the lack of food. Futhermore, Association of health condtions such as depression caused by malnutrition are creating a negative feedback loop that decrease productivity, morals, etc.
